The Concur Developer documentation is organized as follows:

**Overview** Describes how the documentation is organized and describes foundational concepts you need to know so that you can use the Concur APIs more effectively.

**Web Services API Reference** includes the reference documentation for Concur Web Services APIs. Concur Web Services accept requests from an external partner application and reply with Concur data.

**Callouts Reference** includes the documentation for Concur Callouts. Callouts are partner applications that Concur sends data to at a pre-configured step (when a user submits an expense report, for instance). The partner application performs some action based on the data and either returns a response to Concur or uses the web services to modify Concur data.

**Direct Connects Reference** includes documentation for Direct Connects. Direct Connects are partner applications that supply data to Concur. The application receives requests from Concur and returns a set of results for Concur to display to the user. The application can also send and receive updates.
