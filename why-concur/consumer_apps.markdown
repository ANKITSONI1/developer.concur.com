**Your Travel Solution… 25M Travelers**

**In the U.S., business travelers logged 452M trips in one year alone.** Business travelers are the most valuable and engaged of all travelers, and 25M use Concur’s T&E solution. With our APIs, you can build and deliver apps for every part of the trip:

 

*  **Apps For Trip Planning:** With our APIs, you can deliver helpful services before travelers embark. [CIBTVisas](https://www.concur.com/en-us/app-center/listing/nBxalhQlg0zXrpFaTKBLtYeJ5/CIBTvisas-Travel-Documents "CIBTVisas"), for instance, integrates with Concur to alert users on the travel documents, Visas or passports needed based on their itinerary. While [TripIt](https://www.concur.com/en-us/app-center/listing/nBxIQdjJe26HMrcyzCOnxyBi7/TripIt-from-Concur "Tripit") takes all trip details and creates one itinerary that’s there when and where travelers need it.
 
 
*  **Apps for the Road:** With our APIs, you can assist Concur travelers on the go with transportation services like [Curb](https://www.concur.com/en-us/app-center/listing/nBRB8odGjGW1jIO4kXwZsaDZY/Curb "Curb"), [Uber](https://www.concur.com/en-us/app-center/listing/nBxVUUAx3XUp1NZPM2XrADp0yTQ/Uber "Uber") and [Park ‘N Fly](https://www.concur.com/en-us/app-center/listing/nBxQFi1Azy9vsSne$px6EQxmCK/Park-%D4N-Fly-Network "ParkandFly"), and apps that help travelers navigate, like [TripLingo’s](https://www.concur.com/en-us/app-center/listing/nBxOn1HrADL9v1B$sMUfA$pSjbv/TripLingo- "TripLingo") translation tool.
 
 
*  **Apps for Expense Management:** When travelers return with a heap of receipts, Concur automates expense reporting. Apps that simplify reporting are welcome. Blackspark’s [borderFile](https://www.concur.com/en-us/app-center/listing/nDuyQYXiLirrb8645HILsgCA/borderFile "borderfile"), for instance, automates business traveler payroll compliance. While [Visage](https://developer.concur.com/case-study/visage "visage") helps travelers track and submit mobile expenses.

##Building Consumer Apps
Concur users can access consumer apps (“Apps for Me”) from the new Concur App Center. Unlike enterprise apps (“Apps for My Business”), designed for business use, consumer apps do not require additional IT configuration or administration before becoming available to end-users. Because they are designed for individual use, they are scoped to access only data for the individual app user.
