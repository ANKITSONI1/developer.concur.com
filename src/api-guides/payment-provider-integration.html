The Payment Provider App Category streamlines the Invoice Payment process for SAP-Concur customers. The Payment Provider Partner's certified app will obtain Invoice data from our customers' Concur site by using the "Quick Connect" process and executing their app using Concur's Invoice APIs. To be certified, the Partner must support both Editions of SAP-Concur Invoice: Standard Edition and Professional Edition.

[Overview, Scopes, an Obtaining Invoices pending payment] (./https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/invoice/v1.invoice-pay.html#overview)

In order to pay a customer's invoices, the Vendor (aka Supplier) record inside of the SAP-Concur Invoice product must have the value of PAYPVD populated in the "Payment Method Type" field.  This can be populated in 3 ways, one of which is via API.  The Partner and customer need to agree who will be responsible for updating the Vendors initially and on an on-going basis. Here are the methods the Vendor record can be updated:

Option|Technique|Owner responsible for update
---|---|---

Option 1| File import-On-Demand Import via an Excel template within the SAP-Concur Invoice product|Customer completes
Option 2| File import-Scheduled Import via a csv file| Customer completes
Option 3| App integration|Customer and Partner need to coordinate since Vendor master data most likely resides in their ERP
