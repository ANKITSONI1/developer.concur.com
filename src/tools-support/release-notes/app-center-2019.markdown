As a missionary, you need to send regular updates to people interested in your ministry so that they can effectively pray for you and send financial support.

At prayerletters.com, we make it easy for you to send high-quality printed prayer letters quickly and easily.  You simply write your letter and send it to us with your mailing list.  We take care of all the printing, folding, stuffing, and mailing, freeing up your time and energy to minister in the ways you've been gifted.

Our online order system is designed specifically for missionaries.  You can quickly create a mailing, make changes to your list, and resend returned letters, all from your computer, tablet, or phone.  Include gift inserts, reply envelopes, and logos from your ministry with a few clicks.  If we don't have your ministry's logo, let us know and we'll add it for free!

Click “Connect” to link your SAP Concur account. Once linked, we'll send receipts for your orders directly into your account here, simplifying your expense reports.

Contact us any time with questions or to get advice on your prayer letters.  You can also use live chat to interact directly with us during our business hours (US Eastern time).
