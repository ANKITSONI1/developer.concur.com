## Maintenance Schedule

Unplanned maintenance is performed rarely, and limited to high priority fixes. During downtime, any request to the SAP Concur Platform will receive an HTTP 503 error code. To check the current status see [Service Status](https://open.concur.com) where a message will be posted during planned maintenance.
