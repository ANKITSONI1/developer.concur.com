After clicking on the inquiry button the prospect is redirected to the App Center Inquiry form which is dynamic and customized for each partner. The prospect must then complete the form and submit it. After submitting the form the prospect will receive a confirmation page. Thereafter, they will be redirected back to the partner’s App Center listing.
