2018-10-08 :: **Trip Approval v1 API Is Retired**

This API is inactive and is no longer supported. All trip approval functions within Concur Travel and Concur Request will continue to function as usual.  Only the external API endpoint is being retired. More details can be found in the [Trip Approval v1](/api-reference/travel/trip-approval/v1.trip-approval-resource.html) documentation.
