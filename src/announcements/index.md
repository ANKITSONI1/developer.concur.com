2018-10-08 | **Planned Changes: Trip Approval v1 API Is Decommissioned**

Concur has decommissioned the Trip Approval API. This API provided 3rd parties with the ability to manage Concur Travel trip approvals (as required by Concur Travel rules and policy) in systems outside of Concur Travel. This API is inactive and is no longer supported. All trip approval functions within Concur Travel and Concur Request will continue to function as usual.  Only the external API endpoint is being decommissioned. More details can be found in the [Trip Approval v1](/api-reference/travel/trip-approval/v1.trip-approval-resource.html) documentation.

2018-10-02 | **Maintenance Scheduled October 7, 2018**

The SAP Concur EMEA Data Center will be undergoing maintenance from 20:00 CEST on Saturday, October 6, through 06:00 CEST on Sunday, October 7, 2018. During this time, there will be no access to the data center services.
