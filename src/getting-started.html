        <h3>What Can I Do with the SAP Concur APIs?</h3>
        <p>
          SAP Concur APIs allow clients or partners to access data and functions within the SAP Concur product ecosystem. Through
          the use of these exposed endpoints and functions you can solve a vast array of different business issues and reporting
          needs such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pull data from SAP Concur for in-depth reporting services.</li>
          <li>Reconcile or validate your data by comparing SAP Concur data to what you have.</li>
          <li>Post new data into SAP Concur allowing for programmatic creation of information.</li>
          <li>Update existing information in SAP Concur to match your system data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Do I Get Started?</h3>
        <p>
          Once you have an agreement in place SAP Concur will set up a meeting with our technical resource team. They'll go
          through your requirements with you to develop a plan for creating your app or application connector.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that meeting you'll receive the credentials necessary to make your first API call, including a <code>client_id</code> and
          <code>client_secret</code> that you'll use to obtain an <code>access_token</code>. They'll also set up sandboxes and/or implementation entities,
          as needed, for your project and help you work through the development and certification process.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following terms are used when describing the dev environment that works with the APIs.
        </p>

        <h3>Best Practices to Keep in Mind</h3>
        <p>
          We all know you shouldn't write your password on a sticky note and keep it under your keyboard. That said, sometimes
          convenience overrides common sense. Some things to keep in mind as you create your app:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure your app credentials are stored securely and completely separate from each other to avoid mixing the IDs and
          secrets.</li>
          <li>Examples that are provided in the online documentation are for illustration only. Don't copy and paste them into your
          app without verifying their security and stability.</li>
          <li>Real financial data shouldn't be used while developing and testing your app.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>How Do I Authenticate?</h3>
        <p>
          SAP Concur uses OAuth 2.0 an authorization protocol designed to enable third-party applications to obtain limited access
          to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource
          owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing a third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          The APIs implement OAuth 2.0 because it provides a simple mechanism for end-users to grant a partner application access
          to their data (protected resources) without sharing their passwords. It also enables the user to grant limited access to
          their data in terms of scope, duration, and so on. For example, a user (resource owner) can grant a travel app (client)
          access to her protected travel data stored at SAP Concur (resource server), without sharing her username and password
          with the travel app. Instead, she authenticates directly with SAP Concur (authorization server), which issues the travel
          app delegation-specific credentials (access token).
