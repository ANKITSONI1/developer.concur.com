## Introduction to Expense Reports

Concur Expense allows significant customization of the expense report experience. This flexibility means that developers seeking to work with expense report data must be aware of the following expense report configuration information:

Expense reports are composed of multiple data entry segments called forms. There are several types of forms, and there can be more than one form of each type. Each configured form can have a unique set of form fields included on it.

Form fields may be configured as Required or Optional. Some form fields are required by Concur and must always be provided.

Expense reports must contain a Report Header form and can contain one or more Expense Entry forms. The Expense Entry can also contain child forms for Attendees or Allocations.

Use the [Get Available Form Types][16], [Get Form Data][17] and [Get Form Field Details][18] functions to identify the required data for the forms.

The Expense Report web service uses the following forms:

**Report Header**: The data entry page for the summary level report information.

**Expense Entry**: The data entry page for expenses.

**Attendees**: The data entry page for additional people included in an expense. A business meal with clients is a common expense with attendees. Attendee entries are children of the expense entry.

**Allocations**: The data entry page for dividing the responsibility for an expense. Allocation entries consist of a percentage of the original expense, and the configured custom fields. Allocation entries are children of the expense entry.

Expense types are labels used to classify expenses. A policy is a container for configuration data for a group of employees. It determines which expense types the user sees when entering an expense. Use the [Get Expense Group Configuration][19] function to get the list of expense type values for the selected policy. Expense reports that are created using this web service are always assigned the default policy of the supplied user.

## Responses and Errors

Refer to the [HTTP Codes][20] page for details of the common responses and errors.
