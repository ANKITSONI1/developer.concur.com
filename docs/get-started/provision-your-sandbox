title: Provision Your Developer Sandbox
---

Before you build your first application that integrates with Concur, you need to create your own virtual Concur company so that you can develop and test your app. We call this a developer sandbox, or simply a sandbox. A sandbox is different from a Concur free trial. The free trial allows you to try Concur for 30 days and then expires. A sandbox does not expire, and has some features enabled that are specific to Concur Connect API developers
..

## 1.1	Create a sandbox and obtain your credentials

To create a sandbox, follow the procedure below. When you create a sandbox, Concur generates a virtual Concur company, a partner application, and OAuth 2.0 credentials for your user account, including an [access token][1].

u To create your sandbox

1.       Go to the Developer Portal at [https://developer.concur.com][2].

2.     Click the **Sign Up** button at the top right of the page.

3.      Fill in the Sandbox Registration form and click **Submit**.

Important: When you fill in the email address, use an address that is not in use in any Concur products, or is an existing Concur email address—the address must be unique.

Concur automatically creates a partner application for you and generates credentials for your user account.

4.      The Welcome page appears, listing the APIs enabled for your partner application and your OAuth 2.0 credentials: client ID (consumer key in the UI), secret (consumer secret in the UI), and the access token tied to your account.

Important: Copy your client ID (consumer key), secret (consumer secret), and access token and keep them in a safe place. You will need them to make authenticated API requests to your sandbox.

##  1.2   Configure your sandbox

After your sandbox has been created, use the setup process to configure and activate your company. You will also be able to choose the APIs that you want to use for your partner application.

u To configure your sandbox

1.       Click **Get Started** to open the Setup Wizard for the sandbox.

2.     Select values for the fields on the Introduction page, and then click **Next**.

Make sure to select an appropriate option under What type of industry is your company in. This is especially important for healthcare companies, because this selection controls the Attendee Type functionality in the expense entry forms. Healthcare companies should select Medical, Dentist, or Health Service.

3.      You can click **Next** for the rest of the pages without completing them. You will be able to return and configure these pages at any time.

If you want to submit reports for your sandbox company during application testing, you should complete the following pages in the Setup Wizard:

·        **Manage Account Codes:** Add codes in the **Account Code/GL Code** column for each expense type you plan to use.

·        **Employee Reimbursements:** Select the options you want to use for employee reimbursements. Later, you will need to assign the reimbursement type to each user's profile.

If you want to create users during the setup process, make sure to set up employee reimbursements first. When you create a user, you are required to assign a reimbursement type at the same time.

4.      On the final configuration page, you will see a **Done** button instead of a **Next** button. Click **Done**.

5.     Click **Get Started**. You are now on the My Concur page of your sandbox company. To return to the Setup Wizard from the home page, click **Administration > Setup > Expense** in the upper right corner of the page.

6.     The partner application that was created in your sandbox has these APIs enabled by default:
