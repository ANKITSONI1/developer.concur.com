## Set up your developer sandbox

Before you build your first application that integrates with Concur, you should create your own virtual Concur company so that you can develop and test your app. We call this a developer sandbox, or simply a sandbox. 
A sandbox is different from a Concur free trial. The free trial allows you to try Concur for 30 days and then expires. A sandbox does not expire, and has some features enabled that are specific to Concur Connect API developers.

ÔÅµ	To create your sandbox

1. Go to the Developer Portal at https://developer.concur.com.
2. Click the **Sign Up** button at the top right of the page.
3. Fill in the Sandbox Registration form and click **Submit**.    
Concur automatically creates a partner application for you and generates an access token for your user account.
4. The Welcome page appears, listing the APIs enabled for your partner application, your consumer key (known as the client ID in OAuth 2.0), your consumer secret (known as the secret in OAuth 2.0), and the access token tied to your account.    
Important: Copy your consumer key (client ID), consumer secret (secret), and access token and keep them in a safe place. You will need them to make authenticated API requests to your sandbox.
