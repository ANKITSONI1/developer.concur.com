## Description
Concur Travel Request is designed to help businesses control expenses by requiring employees to obtain approval before incurring expenses.The Travel Request web service provides the ability to view requests and update the workflow for travel requests. 

## Product Restrictions
Concur products are highly configurable, and not all clients will have access to all features.

Partner developers must determine which configurations are required for their solution prior to the review process. Use the [Developer Forum][2] if you have questions about the configuration settings.

Existing clients can work with Concur Advantage Technical Services to create customÂ applications that work with their configuration.

## Authentication
The Travel Request web service supports the OAuth 2.0 authentication model. This authentication model is covered in detail in [OAuth 2.0 Overview][3] topic. Any additional required elements for the web service requests are covered in the function documentation.
