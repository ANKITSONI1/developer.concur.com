## Overview

The Concur Itinerary web service can be used to programmatically access travel data such as trips and bookings in the Concur travel system. The Concur Travel system uses this data to match and consolidate bookings it receives from disparate sources and put these into consolidated travelersâ€™ itineraries, providing travelers a convenient way to view their trips in a single itinerary view. Travelers can view their itineraries through mobile applications or other services. The following diagram provides a graphical overview of the Concur Itinerary web service:

### Itineraries and trips

### Itinerary, booking record, and segment

## Authentication and authorization

The Itinerary web service uses OAuth 2.0 for authenticating users and authorizing access to travel data.

### Authorization for TMCs

TMCs can request or send travel bookings in two ways:

* By using an OAuth token for the user the travel booking belongs to. This token allows access to the user's data.
* By using an OAuth token for a user with an administrative role at the company, which allows access to company-wide information. The user who authenticates during this OAuth process must have a Concur account with one of the following user roles: **Web Services Administrator** for Professional, or **Can Administer** for Standard.

### Authorization for TripLink suppliers

The travel supplier can request or send travel bookings by using an OAuth token for the user the travel booking belongs to, generated with the user's involvement.
