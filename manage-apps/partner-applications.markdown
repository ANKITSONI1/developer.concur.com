##  Registering a Partner Application

After a business has passed the Business Development vetting process for App Center partnerships, Partner Enablement will be engaged to establish a sandbox and register an app for the Partner sandboxes.  At this time, Concur Enablement will do this for Ap

The steps to create sandboxes & register an app must take place before a Partner can obtain a JSON Web Token (JWT).  Once the application has been registered, you will receive a clientId, clientSecret and, (in the case of an Enterprise integration) a deep link to a test App Center listing. The clientId is a unique UUID4 identifier for your application, and the clientSecret is your applicationâ€™s password. You will be using this credential to obtain tokens either for the application itself, or on behalf of a user. For more information on this process, please refer to our [Getting Started guide for authentication](/api-reference/authentication/getting-started.html)
