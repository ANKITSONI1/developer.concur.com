  <h2>Setting up a sandbox</h2>
  
  <p>
    Sandboxes are required for partners or customers looking to use Concur's APIs to read and write data from Concur.  It is important that 
    you contact your assigned technical resource at Concur to gain access to a sandbox that best fits your scenario.

    If you are unsure of your technical contact, you can reach out on the Concur Developer <a href="https://forum.developer.concur.com/">

    and someone will be able to help identify the right resource for you.  Indicate in your forum Post one of these 3 goals:
