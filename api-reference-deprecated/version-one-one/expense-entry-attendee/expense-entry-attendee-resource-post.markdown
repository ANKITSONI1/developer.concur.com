**Attendee External ID Considerations**

Attendees can be uniquely identified outside of Concur by their External ID. This value can originate from the attendee system of record, or can be generated by Concur, depending on configuration. In order to manage (add or update) attendees using Concur web services, the attendee must have an External ID value.

Attendees that are shared in Concur (owned by the System) usually have External ID values, which are established when the attendee was added to the system. Developers that work with these attendees should use the required query parameters in the request URI, and should not include the optional AttendeeID query parameter. The External ID value in the request will identify the attendee. These requests must include the SystemOwner element, set to Yes, to indicate that the attendee is part of a shared list.

Attendees that are privately owned or part of shared lists that allow manual addition (not recommended) may not have an External ID, so they cannot initially be uniquely identified by that value. Developers that need to update private attendees (owned by the report owner) or shared attendees that do not have External IDs should use the optional AttendeeID query parameter to identify the attendee. These developers must  provide an External ID value, which they can use to identify the attendee in future requests. For private attendees, this request should include the SystemOwner element, set to No, to indicate that the attendees are private. For shared attendees, this request should include the SystemOwner element, set to Yes.

**NOTES:**

* Posting expense report information is a multi-stage process. Refer to the [Processes](https://developer.concur.com/node/465#process) section of the Expense Report Web Service page for the steps required to post new expense reports and entries.
