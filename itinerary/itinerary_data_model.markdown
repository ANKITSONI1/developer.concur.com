## Itinerary Data Model
The Itinerary data model defines data elements  that are returned or sent when getting, creating, updating, or deleting trips and bookings with the /api/travel/trip/v1.1 and /api/travel/booking/v1.1 resources respectively. 
Trips include all bookings in an itinerary whereas a booking includes only a specific segment of an itinerary.
